### User Input
'''
Cheatsheet (Processing User Input)
In this section, you learned that:

A Python program can get user input via the input function:

The input function halts the execution of the program and gets text input from the user:

name = input("Enter your name: ")
The input function converts any input to a string, but you can convert it back to int or float:

experience_months = input("Enter your experience in months: ")
experience_years = int(experience_months) / 12
You can format strings with (works both on Python 2 and 3):

name = "Sim"
experience_years = 1.5
print("Hi %s, you have %s years of experience." % (name, experience_years))
Output: Hi Sim, you have 1.5 years of experience.

You can also format strings with:

name = "Sim"
experience_years = 1.5
print("Hi {}, you have {} years of experience".format(name, experience_years))
Output: Hi Sim, you have 1.5 years of experience.
